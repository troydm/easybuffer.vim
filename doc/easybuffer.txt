:EasyBuffer[!]
    Opens an quick switch buffer in current window
    If [!] is specified shows unlisted buffers too
    To switch to another buffer just press the corresponding key or buffer number
    If first key sequence pressed matches more than one buffer you can finish 
    key sequence by pressing <Enter> key
    For example you have following buffers in quick switch:
        <Key> <BufNr> <Mode>  <BufName>
          a     1      #a     buffer1
          aa    2       h     buffer2
          as    3       u=    buffer3
    To switch to a buffer just press a and then press <Enter> to complete key sequence 
    Same rule applies to using buffer number key sequences
    To delete buffer move your cursor to the line corresponding to that buffer and press d 
    To wipeout buffer move your cursor to the line corresponding to that buffer and press D 
    To refresh current buffer list just press R
    To quickly go to line corresponding to some buffer press same key sequnce only in uppercase
    To close quick switch buffer just press q

                                                                  *EasyBufferHorizontal*
